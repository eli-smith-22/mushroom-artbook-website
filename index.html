<h2> Artist Book Mushroom Substrate Experiment</h2>
<p> In my Artist book, I wanted to experiment with creating book pages out of substrates that can support mycelial life.</p>

<p>A mushroom substrate is an underlying substance used to feed and host mycelium as it grows and eventually fruits into a mushroom. There are many different kinds of substrates that a mushroom can grow on and people are always experimenting with new materials. In Nature, many mushrooms grow well on hardwood trees but this can differ by species. Many mushrooms also grow best on deciduous/rotting woods because they are decomposers. This again differs depending on the type of mushroom you are growing.
</p>
<p>When growing mushrooms inside a cultivator must either sterilize or pasteurize their mushroom substrate because molds can quickly grow in the same environments that mushrooms grow. Sterilization refers to eliminating all of the contaminants in a substrate while pasteurization kills the majority of contaminates. Sterilization eliminates anything that could compete with the mycelium providing a blank slate for mushroom growth. Pasteurization gives the mycelium enough of a head start to colonize the substrate before any molds or contaminants can take over.</p>

<p>In this experiment, I hypothesized about how mycelium (specifically Pleurotus ostreatus)
would react to the different structures and substrates I worked within my pages. The main substrate I worked with was cardboard but I also supplemented this cardboard with cotton, straw, and coffee. Below you can view the research I’ve collected on cardboard as a mushroom substrate as well as research about the various materials I used to supplement the cardboard.

<h3 id="Book_Pages">Book Pages</h3>
<p>This section includes images and descriptions of the different book pages I created as well as my hypotheses about how the mycelium might react to these pages and how well the mycelium would grow on/colonize these pages.
</p>
<h5 id="Cardboard"> Cardboard:</h5>
<p>Cardboard is often discarded as trash but can also be recycled to grow mushrooms. Oyster Mushrooms (p. ostreatus) are an aggressive wood-loving mushroom that work well with this substrate. The aggressive and resilient nature of Oyster Mushrooms allows them to grow well on Cardboard which is quite low in nutrients. Because cardboard is low in nutritional value it is actually at less risk for contaminants (Other fungi and molds.) When preparing this substrate for mushroom inoculation many cultivators have seen success using pasteurization methods instead of full sterilization methods.
</p>

<h5>Cardboard Paper Page</h5>
<p><img src="cardboard.JPG" width="300"></p>
<p>This page is made from only cardboard pulp. The cardboard paper doesn’t have a lot of aeration but because the paper is thin I predict the mycelium should still be able to colonize the paper well. When the mycelium completely covers the paper the mycelium will probably lie dormant because of the lack of food available.</p>
<h5>Woven Cardboard Page</h5>
<p><img src="wovencardboard.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>This page is made from actual cardboard and not cardboard pulp. I predict the tightly woven cardboard will support fast colonization of mycelium due to the structure of the cardboard. The corrugated structure allows for aeration which supports mycelial growth. The corrugated structure is even more accessible to the mycelium because the cardboard is cut which exposes the structure. It is also woven together which provides a little bit more aeration without the gaps being too wide. Where the weaving becomes more abstract I predict the mycelium will colonize with more trouble than where the weaving is more structured because of the large gaps between the cardboard.
</p>
<h5>Grid Cardboard Paper page</h5>
<p><img src="gridcardboard.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>This page is made from solely cardboard pulp. The pulp is thick and clumped in places forming a sculptural grid pattern. The mycelium might have difficulty colonizing this page due to the lack of aeration however, The extra pulp provides more food for the mycelium. I predict this added food will most likely support a longer grow time for the mycelium. It’s hard to say if it's enough substrate to form a fruiting body but I don’t think it’s impossible. The grid structure could keep the grain spawn in more uniform pools on the paper. I don’t know how this would affect growth rates and if it would be beneficial or detrimental. One concern I have is that sometimes when grainspawn is too concentrated in one area and doesn’t have enough substrate it can compete with itself and it will grow slower. Sometimes it will not fully colonize the substrate.</p>
<h5 id="Cotton">Cardboard Supplemented with Cotton</h5>
<p>Cotton is made of natural plant fiber so should theoretically be able to support mushroom life. Cotton is not often used as a nutritional supplement for mushroom substrate. Instead some of the research i’ve seen with growing mushrooms on cotton focuses on breaking down and recycling old textiles with mycoremediation. Tradd Cotter is a mycologist and author who has done a lot of research on mycoremediation as a way to produce food and restore the environment. (He wrote a book about mycoremediation called “Organic Mushroom Farming and Mycoremediation”.) Using cotton as a substrate is particularly interesting to me because I want to explore the overlap between fibers and mushrooms. I have not seen any information about if cotton is able to be pasteurized instead of sterilized when preparing for mushroom inoculation. I would predict that it would benefit from using sterilization techniques over pasteurization techniques.
</p>
<h5>Cotton-Cardboard Paper page</h5>
<p><img src="cottonandcardboard.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>I used muslin cotton scraps for the cotton fibers in this page. In preparing the cotton to be added to my paper pulp I shredded it as much as I could. I was really trying to get it down to its most fibrous form. I predict that the loose fibers will be easier for the mycelium to colonize than the tightly woven fabric. I will be interested to see what the mycelium growth rate for cotton is and how it differs from cardboard. I wonder what kind of impact this would have on the mycelial colonization of the entire page. Both the structure of the cardboard pulp and cotton fibers can support less aeration, however this may differ when they are combined.
</p>
<h5 id="Straw">Cardboard Supplemented with Straw</h5>
<p>Cereal straws are a great substrate to grow oyster mushrooms on. They are low in nutrients so they can be pasteurized. When preparing it as a substrate it is beneficial to cut the straw into 1-4 inch pieces. The texture of the straw easily supports aeration.
</p>
<h5>Straw-Cotton-Cardboard page</h5>
<p><img src="strawcardboardcotton.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>This page consists of Cardboard pulp, cotton fibers, and straw. I Introduced straw as a supplement because it can provide aeration within the page. I predict the Oyster mushroom mycelium will rapidly colonize this page because of the high cellulose content of the cardboard and the straw as well as the aerated structure of the page.
</p>
<h5>Thicc Straw-Cotton-Cardboard page</h5>
<p><img src="thickstrawcardboardcotton.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>This page combined two of the Straw-Cotton-Cardboard pages to make an extra thick page. I predict the thickness of the page will provide the mycelium with more food. This will in turn extend the growth time of the mycelium and could possibly allow the mycelium to fruit.
</p>
<h5 id="Coffee">Cardboard Supplemented with Coffee</h5>
<p>Coffee is a common supplement for mushroom substrate as it has a high nutritional value. It is beneficial to supplement low nutrient substrates with coffee grounds because it can often speed up mycelium colonization. There are problems that can arise when coffee is used as a sole substrate. The small particle size of coffee grounds easily condenses and doesn’t provide great aeration because of this. The high nutritional content of coffee can attract other contaminants much easier. When using it as a supplement for a substrate the act of brewing coffee is effective to pasteurize the coffee grounds in preparation for inoculation.This only works if the coffee grounds are freshly brewed (within 24hrs of brewing).</p>
<p>I supplemented three types of pages with brewed coffee pigment and a teaspoon of coffee grounds to see if it would help the mycelium grow easier and faster.</p>

<h3 id="Process">Cardboard Pulp/Paper Making Process</h3>
<p>Step 1: tear up cardboard into small pieces and soak in was until soft (1 hour is fine)
</p>
<p>Step 2: Blend cardboard pieces with water in a blender until you get a smooth paste with no big chunks.
</p>
<p><img src="Step2.JPG" width="400"></p>
<p>Step 3:Fill a bin big enough for your mold and deckle with water. Add handfuls of pulp to water. To test pulp levels for making an average sheet paper you can stir up the water and then scoop it into your hand. there should only be a few particles of pulp visible in your hand. If you want thicker paper simply add more pulp.
</p>
<p>*When supplementing paper with cut straw or shredded cotton fibers you would add those materials into the water with the pulp.*
</p>
<p>Step 4: Stir water around to mix pulp particles up then submerge mold and deckle into pulp water. As you lift the mold and deckle out of the pulp water, shake it around so that the pulp is distributed evenly.

<p>Step 5: Place mold face down on a cotton sheet with the paper pulp touching the fabric.
</p>
<p>Step 6: Use a sponge to sop up excess water on the back side of the mold
